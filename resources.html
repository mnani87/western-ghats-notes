                        This page gathers a small set of books, articles and
                        online tools that are useful for understanding the
                        Western Ghats and for doing field natural history in
                        general. It is meant to stay short and practical, not
                        exhaustive.

                    <h2>How to use this page</h2>
                    <p>
                        The lists below are organised by purpose. Start with one
                        or two items that match your current interest and
                        actually read or use them in the field. Over time, this
                        page will grow slowly as new references prove themselves
                        useful in practice.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Books and field guides</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are books you can carry, mark and return to. Many
                        are not specific to the Western Ghats but are still
                        valuable for anyone working in these hills.

                    <h2>Online tools and databases</h2>
                    <p>
                        A few links that are especially useful when planning
                        trips, checking records or listening to calls.

                            For example, regional portals that show hotspots,
                            species lists and seasonal patterns.

                            Collections of bird and insect recordings that you
                            can use to compare with your own soundscapes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Maps and elevation tools</strong><br />
                            Simple elevation and satellite tools that help you
                            understand why a valley or ridge behaves the way it
                            does.

                    <h2>Organisations and courses</h2>
                    <p>
                        A short list of organisations that run field courses,
                        walks or long-term work in and around the Western Ghats.

                    <p>
                        As issues of Notes from the Western Ghats accumulate,
                        this section will collect a small number of references
                        that are cited often in the essays. It is not a full
                        bibliography, only a set of recurring sources that are
                        worth owning or returning to.
                    </p>

                            <strong>[Reference linked to Issue 1]</strong><br />
                            One or two lines on how it connects to
                            <em>What to See When You See a Tree</em>.

                            ><br />
                            Short note on why it continues to be useful.

                    <h2>Keeping it small</h2>
                    <p>
                        This page will stay deliberately short. New entries will
                        only be added when they have actually been used, tested
                        and found helpful in the field or at the desk. The aim
                        is to build a trusted shelf, not a directory.
