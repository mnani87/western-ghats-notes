                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Regard a tree on any ridge of the Western Ghats, and the illusion of the
                        solitary object dissolves. We are conditioned to see a plant - something
                        tall, green, rooted, recognisable: a noun in a world of nouns. But stand
                        long enough with one specimen, perhaps a towering
                        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vateria_indica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vateria indica</a></em>
                        rising from the valley floor, and the category collapses. You are not
                        looking at a plant. You are looking at the visible edge of a much larger
                        structure: the basalt slope beneath, the shear of wind above, the monsoon
                        that carved the hillside, and the networks of fungi, insects, and birds
                        that move invisibly through the wood. A tree is not a unit. It is the
                        cross-section of a system.

                    <h4>Stone and Root</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the Western Ghats, this insight is not theoretical. It is felt. This
                        mountain range receives the full force of the Arabian Sea weather systems,
                        and the topography amplifies every relationship. The underlying geology is
                        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deccan Traps</a>, a staircase of ancient basalt flows
                        weathered into terraces, fracture lines, and narrow shelves. The stone is
                        chemically austere and physically unforgiving. Because the ground offers
                        little easily, the root of every tree becomes a strategist.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It does not simply penetrate the earth. It negotiates with it. On
                        wind-scoured plateaus, roots etch the basalt with weak acids, dissolving
                        mineral grain by grain over decades. On steep lateritic slopes, they
                        abandon depth and weave laterally instead, forming tensile mats that grip
                        the soil against the violence of the monsoon. When you look at the base of
                        a tree in the Ghats, you are seeing the compromise between the biological
                        desire for height and gravity’s constant attempt to tear it down.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Wind and Form</h4>
                    <p>
                        Higher up the ridge, the dominant force changes. It is no longer gravity
                        but wind. The westerlies that hit the Ghats during the monsoon are not
                        breezes. They are fluid hammers, striking the canopy thousands of times
                        every hour. Trees record this punishment in their architecture. On an
                        exposed shoulder, a tree flags to one side. Branches on the windward face
                        are suppressed, while those on the sheltered side stretch outward in a
                        long, unbalanced arc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigmomorphogenesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thigmomorphogenesis</a>, growth shaped by repeated touch and
                        pressure. The tree feels the force and reinforces its tissues, adding
                        lignin where the bending moment is highest. Even a novice naturalist can
                        sketch the wind map of a valley by studying the silhouettes at dusk.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Move into a sheltered shola forest and the form reverses. Here the wind is
                        quiet, and the same species can rise in a rounded crown, soft and
                        symmetrical. Sholas often show crown shyness, a phenomenon where
                        neighbouring trees keep narrow gaps between their canopies. The form is
                        different because the forces are different. The tree is a fluid diagram of
                        the atmosphere.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Water and Light</h4>
                    <p>
                        Drop down into the humid evergreen zone and the bark becomes a record of
                        moisture. On these slopes, trunks are coated with bryophytes, liverworts,
                        and small ferns. Higher on the branches, orchids anchor themselves and
                        draw water from the mist. This epiphytic load changes the physics of the
                        tree entirely. At the height of the monsoon, a single canopy giant in
                        these cloud-soaked forests can hold enormous volumes of water in its moss
                        and root masses, sometimes measured in thousands of litres. Rain does not
                        simply fall through these forests. It gets caught.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The tree becomes a vertical reservoir. It slows the rain, releases
                        moisture gradually, and feeds the streams long after the season has ended.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Look closely at the bark and you will see a palimpsest. Crustose lichens
                        form white and grey patches that track air quality and humidity.
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foliose_lichen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foliose lichens</a> appear where conditions are even cleaner. If the
                        bark is peeling, the tree may be shedding its surface to free itself of
                        vines or fungal crusts. Every square centimetre is a weather diary.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The leaves add finer resolution. In deep shade, the laminas are broad and
                        soft, angled to catch diffuse light. On the exposed ridge, they become
                        thick, waxy, or reduced to tough ovals to resist drying winds. The drip
                        tips of rainforest species such as <em>Hopea</em> and many figs are not
                        decorative. They serve a precise function: they channel water quickly, so
                        algae does not form a film that blocks the light. Leaf angles signal more
                        secrets. A slight downward tilt before the rains can precede the first
                        thunderstorm by weeks. Trees respond to humidity and barometric cues with
                        a sensitivity that surprises anyone who has watched them long enough.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Forest Network</h4>
                    <p>
                        Trees are never alone. They host ants, beetles, cicadas, birds, and bats.
                        These creatures act as indicators of tree health and larger ecological
                        processes. A rhinoceros beetle at the base signals a functioning deadwood
                        cycle. A chorus of bulbuls high in the canopy suggests a fig in fruit. The
                        pitch of cicadas shifts with temperature and time of day. A silent trunk
                        is often a warning. The soil beneath may be compacted by grazing, or a
                        fire may have swept through years ago and broken the chain of
                        decomposers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beneath the soil lies the most intricate layer of all. The roots of many
                        Western Ghats species are entwined with mycorrhizal fungi. These
                        filaments link trees into networks that move carbon and nutrients. This
                        system is sometimes called the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wood wide web</a>, although the term can mislead. It is not a
                        hive mind. It is closer to a marketplace shaped by constraints. A large
                        <em>Vateria indica</em> in its prime may supply carbon to shaded saplings,
                        and a sickly tree may contribute nutrients it cannot use. The forest floor
                        becomes an economy where energy and minerals shift constantly, unseen yet
                        essential.

                    <h4>Memory and Pattern</h4>
                    <p>
                        Seen through this wider frame, a tree stops being an object and becomes a
                        node. Complexity science calls this
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emergence</a>. Patterns arise from interactions, not from single
                        components. A tree is shaped by rain only because the rain meets the slope
                        at a particular angle, the soil holds a particular depth, the wind carries
                        a certain force, the fungi supply a specific mineral profile, and the
                        neighbouring canopies compete for light. Alter one input and the form
                        adjusts. Not by choice, but by necessity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A tree is also memory made visible. Inside the trunk, the rings record
                        rainfall patterns. On the bark, scars record old fires. In the crown,
                        broken branches show where a storm once passed. Along a single slope,
                        trees may share a common history, but each carries that history with
                        different emphases. The valley floor remembers the flood, and the ridge
                        remembers the wind. This is why two adjacent valleys can feel like
                        separate countries. The species may be the same, but the flows of light,
                        moisture, and wind differ just enough to create new outcomes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Diagnostic Gaze</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once you learn to read trees this way, you cannot stop. Every walk becomes
                        an investigation. Why is one crown leaning downhill while the others are
                        straight? Why has lichen vanished from this patch? Why are there no
                        saplings under a mature canopy? The answers often reveal changes in
                        hydrology, soil structure, or human disturbance. These questions are not
                        academic. They are practical tools for reading terrain and predicting the
                        movement of water and wind.
                    </p>

                    <h4>A Conversation with the Mountain</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Western Ghats demand this literacy. Steep, narrow, rain-fed, and full
                        of microclimates, they reward close attention. A tree does not stand
                        alone. It stands with the rock, the cloud, the wind, the fungi, and the
                        fauna. It is a conversation between the soil and the sky, and the
                        conversation never stops.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And so, what about that <em>Vateria indica</em>? If you take one habit
                        from this issue, let it be this: pause before the tree. Do not just name
                        it. Naming ends the inquiry. Instead, ask what shaped it, what it is
                        responding to, and what it is recording. Trees do not speak in words. They
                        speak in form. That form is never random. It is the visible expression of
                        a relationship. To see the tree is to see the system - and to realise how
                        much still remains unseen. From that moment on, you read the Ghats
                        themselves differently.

                    <h4>Back to the <em>Vateria indica</em></h4>

                    <p>
                        With these thoughts, I walk up to the <em>Vateria indica</em> I know, beside a housing complex called “Forest Life,” on the outskirts of Pune. This was once
                        the last line of buildings before the scrub and slope began. The tree had
                        stood just beyond the township wall, a single column of shade at the edge
                        of the plateau, and I had filed it away as a future lesson in how basalt,
                        wind, and monsoon write themselves into wood. The last time I had seen it
                        was six months earlier, at the start of the rains, when cicadas were
                        still loud in the gullies and the soil held the promise of fresh life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This time there is no shade, no trunk, no lichen script to read.  In its
                        place is a levelled, compacted rectangle of earth, ringed with steel rods
                        and heaps of brick, a bare stage waiting for concrete. The soil holds marks of truck-tyres. At the spot where the tree stood, a
                        flex board leans in the dust:
                    </p>

                        Studio apartments and villas - best rates!</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whatever that <em>Vateria indica</em> had been recording - the slow
                        negotiation of root and rock, the years of wind, the rise and fall of
                        groundwater - has been erased in a season, its memory flattened into a plot
                        number and a marketing line. The ridge will still remember the monsoon,
                        but now through drains and parapets instead of bark and crown. That is
                        what has become of the <em>Vateria indica</em> of Bhugaon. This, too, is
                        part of what you see when you look closely at a tree.

                            a
                            <strong>female Rhinoceros Beetle</strong> (likely
                            <em>Oryctes</em> sp.). Males carry a long, curved
                            horn used in combat; females replace it with this
                            small triangular tubercle. What she lacks in display
                            structures she makes up for in power. The thick,
                            spined forelegs and smooth, heavy elytra belong to a
                            beetle built for pushing through soil, leaf litter,
                            and rotting wood. These insects are quiet engineers
                            of the forest floor, turning over soil and helping
                            moisture and microbes move through the landscape.

                            The stepped cliffs on the left show the classic
                            horizontal layering of the Deccan Traps, ancient
                            lava flows stacked over time. The vegetation mirrors
                            these structures. Deep-green forests settle in the
                            valley where moisture lingers, while the ridges and
                            exposed faces carry lighter, wind-shaped scrub. The

                            and slope together organise life in these mountains.

                                Tropical rainforests are complex ecosystems,
                                home to numerous plants and animals that are

                                Conservation Foundation, Divya Mudappa and TR
                                Shankar Raman, as they work with their team to
